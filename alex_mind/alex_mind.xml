			<p>If your character has a sailor background, with the variant 'Living ship' you must select Ihis background feature instead of Ship’s Passage.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with ensouled Ships. They can give you information about nearby locations and Monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a ship to perform a small favor for you, at the DM's discretion.
A ship might be ensouled either based on history, loving crew or other reasons, your DM might decide on.
You cannot force the ship to take actions against it's will or those of it's crew.
